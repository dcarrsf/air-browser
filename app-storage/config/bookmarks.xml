Edit your default bookmarks here. To remove bookmarks from the initial installation,
leave the bookmarks XML file in the config folder, but delete the contents. Enter the 
page title (or desired page title) in the <label> field and add a <url> containing the 
URL to the page in the data node. You can use absolute URLs for remote links and 
relative URLs for local links. Be sure that if you enter relative paths they will work
on the target OS of your audience.
